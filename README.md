*Project Completion Date:* December 8, 2022

Our final project for COOP Fall 2022 was a client project. Our client [RootedIn](https://berootedin.com/) wanted to analyze their insights on their social media and website traffic. There were 16 total members divided into four subteams: Site Traffic and User Engagement using Google Analytics<sup>1</sup>, Facebook and Instagram Analysis, Email Analysis, Tiktok Analysis.

<sup>1</sup> Team consists of Raquel Castromonte, Elizabeth Tum, Alexandra Reyes, Andre Cunalata.

- Conduced a data analysis report on the success and shortcomings of the company using Google Analytics for insights and Microsoft Excel for visualizations. 
- Developed an action plan to increase brand awareness in the company’s social media and search engine optimization for their website by using Google Ads or Bing Ads.
-	Successful scheduled communication between group members and client to transparentize client’s goals, project purpose, and work progress.
