*Project Completion Date:* December 8, 2022

Our final project for COOP Fall 2022 was a client project. Our client [RootedIn](https://berootedin.com/) wanted to analyze their insights on their social media and website traffic. There were 16 total members divided into four subteams: Site Traffic and User Engagement using Google Analytics<sup>1</sup>, Facebook and Instagram Analysis, Email Analysis, Tiktok Analysis.

<sup>1</sup> Team consists of Raquel Castromonte, Elizabeth Tum, Alexandra Reyes, Andre Cunalata.

- Examined company’s site traffic and audience engagement using Google Ads, Google Analytics, SEO, and spreadsheets functions. 
- Created an action plan that includes quality keywords for more organic traffic, seasonal sale codes for audience retention, and site sign-up forms that will increase site conversions by 25%. 
- Organized campaign data using pivot tables and dashboards on PowerBI.

*Project Completion Date:* October 13, 2022

As a COOP aprentice, my team and I explored the public New York City Eviction Data. Link to our project repository [here](https://github.com/raquelCastromonte/NYC_evictions).

**Collaborators:** Raquel Castromonte, Elizabeth Tum, Alexandra Reyes, Andre Cunalata.

- Cleaned New York City’s public dataset on evictions using SQL and Excel to ease data analysis. 
- Produced data visualizations that mapped evictions by neighborhoods, boroughs, and by demographics such as race and age in Python (matplotlib). 
- Read NYC eviction laws to explain correlations of neighborhood composition, evictions over time, and eviction moratorium due to COVID-19.
